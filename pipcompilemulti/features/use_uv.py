Enable UV
=========

UV is an extremely fast Python package installer and resolver written in Rust.
When enabled, pip-compile-multi will use uv's dependency resolver instead of pip-tools.

.. code-block:: text

    --uv / --no-uv      Use uv for dependency resolution.

Key differences between uv and pip-tools output:

1. Annotations:

   - UV doesn't support pip-tools style annotations (via/from comments).
   - The ``--no-annotate`` flag is automatically added when using uv.

2. Performance:

   - UV is significantly faster at dependency resolution.
   - Particularly noticeable in large projects with complex dependency trees.

3. Output Format:

   - UV produces cleaner output without header comments.
   - Package versions are still pinned exactly like pip-tools.
   - Hash generation (``--generate-hashes``) works the same way.

4. Version Resolution:

   - UV may occasionally resolve to slightly different versions than pip-tools.
   - Both tools respect version constraints equally.
   - UV's resolver is more aggressive at finding newer versions.

To use UV:

- Install ``uv`` (``pip install uv``)
- Use the ``--uv`` flag with commands: ``lock --uv``, ``upgrade --uv``, ``verify --uv``
